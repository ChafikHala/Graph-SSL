# Graph Self-Contrastive Learning

**MDS Project**

This repository contains an implementation of a Graph Contrastive Learning pipeline using **Weisfeiler-Leman Hyperbolic Networks (WLHN)**[cite: 1, 40].

### Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage hyperbolic geometry to capture the hierarchical structure of graphs defined by the **Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) isomorphism test**[cite: 8, 41]. 

By embedding the WL hierarchy into the Poincaré ball, we aim to learn more robust distance-preserving node and graph representations for self-supervised tasks[cite: 12, 48].
