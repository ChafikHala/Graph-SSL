This repository contains a structured exploration and **implementation of the GCN model from [Kipf & Welling (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)**:  
*"Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks"*.  
It covers the **theoretical foundations**, **implementations**, **experiments on benchmark datasets**, and **visualizations of graph learning dynamics**.  
This work serves as a foundation for understanding Graph Neural Networks before moving to Graph Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).
